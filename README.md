# Island-Flu-Simulation
Group project for Statistics 101B at UCLA, Spring 2020. 

Using The Island simulator, we performed a four factor mixed effects repeated measures design on participants with the goal of understanding how lifestyle activities like running, meditation, and petting animals can effect flu recovery -- both physical and mental.
